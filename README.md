Evolution of Semiott Society into a Sign System for Post Pandemic Political Economies

## Prelude
- Semiott is a Sign System for the Secure and Scalable Streaming of Economic Assets in the form of Protocols, Products and Platforms. 
- Semiott has been operating as a Decentralised Signature System for Financial Markets and Economic Architectures ever since 2020. 

## Concepts
- Financial Systems are constructed with real, surreal and unreal assets. 
- Each and every type of assets contains an intrinsic value and an extrinsic value
- Intrinsic value has to be stored in its innate form enmeshed within the abstractions.
- Extrinsic value has to be represented in a higher order sign system for the seamless communication.
